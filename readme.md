My solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles in Rust.

# Solutions with Times

Below is a Table that holds all of the times for each puzzle as well as the link to the solution source code. These were all run on a laptop with an i5-9300H Intel CPU. Every time was profiled by using release mode (`--release`) instead of debug mode (no flag).
